- âš¡I got into coding from watching Sci-fi movies when I was younger and understood that coding can be the crucial part to shift the world around and change people's perspective. I have been enjoying software engineering ever since I partook in a team of Computer Science students to build a Volunteer Management System for a non-profit organization using PHP. I am currently on the lookout for a role in both backend and frontend development, ideally writing Java, Python, PHP, and JavaScript. I would love to work in a growing business where I can make an impact. If you are hiring, let's chat.
- ðŸ”­ I have over 5 years of coding and learning experience, complemented by hands-on software development projects.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning ML/AI on AWS and React library.

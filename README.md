- âš¡About me: I got into coding from watching Sci-fi movies when I was younger and understood that coding can be the crucial part to shift the world around and change people's perspective. I have been enjoying software engineering ever since I partook in a team of Computer Science students to build a Volunteer Management System for a non-profit organization using PHP. I am currently on the lookout for a role in full-stack development, ideally writing Java or PHP. I would love to work in a growing business where I can make an impact. If you are hiring, let's chat.
